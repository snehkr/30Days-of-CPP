### üèõÔ∏è Standard Template Library : Definitions

- **Definition:**

  - STL stands for Standard Template Library in C++, which is a powerful collection of template classes and functions that provide general-purpose classes and functions with templates that implement many popular and commonly used algorithms and data structures like vectors, lists, queues, and stacks.

  - STL is a part of the C++ Standard Library and is designed to work seamlessly with other C++ features.

### üèõÔ∏è Standard Template Library : Questions and Answers

#### Question 1Ô∏è‚É£ : Using STL Vector

- **Answer:**

  - Check `Question1.cpp`
  - The program creates a vector of integers and prints its elements using an iterator.

#### Question 2Ô∏è‚É£ : Using STL Map

- **Answer:**

  - Check `Question2.cpp`
  - The program uses a map to store age information for individuals and then prints the contents of the map.

#### Question 3Ô∏è‚É£ : Using STL Algorithm

- **Answer:**

  - Check `Question3.cpp`
  - The program uses the std::sort algorithm to sort a vector of integers in ascending order.

#### Question 4Ô∏è‚É£ : Using STL Stack

- **Answer:**
  - Check `Question4.cpp`
  - The program demonstrates the usage of a stack by pushing elements onto it and then popping and printing them.

#### Question 5Ô∏è‚É£ : Using STL Iterator

- **Answer:**

  - Check `Question5.cpp`
  - The program uses an iterator to double each element in a vector of integers and then prints the modified vector.

1. Syntax:

   - C++ programs are made up of functions, and the basic structure of a C++ program includes the following:

   ```cpp
   #include <iostream>
   int main() { // Your code here return 0; }
   ```

2. Token:

   - Tokens are the smallest individual units in a program. They can be keywords, identifiers, constants, operators, etc.

3. Comment:

   - C++ supports two types of comments:

   ```cpp
   // This is a single-line comment

   /_ This is a multi-line comment _/
   ```

4. Keyword:

   - Keywords are reserved words in C++ that have special meanings and cannot be used as identifiers. Examples include int, double, if, else, etc.

5. Variables & Constants:

   - Variables are used to store data, and constants are used to represent fixed values.

   ```cpp
   int age = 25; // Variable const double PI = 3.14; // Constant
   ```

6. Data Types:

   - C++ supports various data types, including int, double, char, bool, etc.

   ```cpp
   int integerVar = 10;
   double doubleVar = 3.14;
   char charVar = 'A';
   bool boolVar = true;
   ```

7. Operators:

   - C++ supports various operators, such as arithmetic, relational, logical, assignment, etc.

   ```cpp
   int a = 5, b = 2;
   int sum = a + b;
   int product = a \* b;
   bool isEqual = (a == b);
   ```

8. Input/Output:

   - Input and output operations are performed using cin and cout for standard input and output, respectively.

   ```cpp
   #include <iostream>
   int main() {
     int number;
     std::cout << "Enter a number: ";
     std::cin >> number; std::cout << "You entered: " << number << std::endl;
     return 0;
     }
   ```

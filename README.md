## ✅ Day 1: Setup

### Install a C++ compiler and a code editor.

    • Install GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) or Visual Studio as your compiler. Choose a code editor such as VS Code, Sublime Text, or any other you're comfortable with.

## ❌ Day 2-3: Basics of Syntax

### Learn about basic C++ syntax, variables, and data types.

    • Read online tutorials or use learning platforms like Codecademy or Khan Academy to understand fundamental C++ syntax.

## ❌ Day 4-5: Control Flow

### Explore control flow statements (if, else, switch) and loops (for, while).

    • Write simple programs to practice using these statements. Print patterns or solve basic problems using loops.

## ❌ Day 6-7: Functions

### Understand functions, function prototypes, parameters, and return types.

    • Write functions for simple mathematical operations. Practice calling functions with different arguments.

## ❌ Day 8-10: Arrays and Strings

### Dive into arrays and strings in C++.

    • Create programs that manipulate arrays and strings. Practice iterating through arrays and performing operations on strings.

## ❌ Day 11-12: Introduction to OOP

### Learn the basics of object-oriented programming (OOP) - classes and objects.

    • Write a simple class and create objects. Understand the concept of encapsulation.

## ❌ Day 13-15: Advanced OOP Concepts

### Learn about inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.

    • Extend your previous class with inheritance. Implement polymorphism and explore abstraction and encapsulation concepts.

## ❌ Day 16-17: STL - Vectors, Lists, Queues

### Explore the Standard Template Library (STL) - vectors, lists, and queues.

    • Create programs using these STL containers. Understand their methods and properties.

## ❌ Day 18-20: STL - Maps, Sets, Algorithms

### Study maps, sets, and algorithms provided by the STL.

    • Implement programs using maps and sets. Explore algorithms like sorting and searching in the STL.

## ❌ Day 21-22: File Handling

### Understand file input/output operations in C++.

    • Write programs that read from and write to files. Practice error handling for file operations.

## ❌ Day 23-25: Exception Handling

### Dive into exception handling with try, catch, and throw statements.

    • Create programs that handle exceptions gracefully. Practice catching different types of errors.

## ❌ Day 26-27: Mini Project

### Work on a small project. Choose something that interests you.

    • Start planning and coding your project. It could be a simple game, a data management system, or any other application.

## ❌ Day 28-30: Advanced Concepts

### Explore advanced C++ concepts like pointers, dynamic memory allocation, and templates.

    • Apply these concepts in your mini project. Experiment with templates and dynamic memory.

## üåè Brief History of C++ :

- 1979 - 1983: The Origins (C with Classes):

  - In 1979, Bjarne Stroustrup, a Danish computer scientist, started working on "C with Classes" at Bell Labs.
  - The idea was to extend the C language by adding features of Simula (a programming language designed for simulations) while retaining the efficiency of C.

- 1983: C++ is Born:

  - In 1983, Stroustrup officially introduced the new language and named it "C++."
  - The "++" represents the increment operator in C, signifying an improvement over C.

- 1985: The First Edition:
  - The first edition of "The C++ Programming Language" by Bjarne Stroustrup was published, outlining the language's features and concepts.
- 1989: Standardization (C++ 2.0):

  - The first standardized version of C++ (C++ 2.0) was released.
  - The standardization process aimed to ensure the portability and consistency of C++ across different platforms.

- 1990s: Growing Popularity:

  - Throughout the 1990s, C++ gained popularity for its versatility and efficiency.
  - It became widely used in various domains, including systems programming, game development, and large-scale software projects.

- 1998: ISO/IEC 14882:1998 (C++98):

  - The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) published the first international standard for C++, known as C++98.
  - This standard introduced several new features and improvements.

- 2003: C++03 Standard:

  - A minor update to the C++98 standard, known as C++03, was released to fix issues and clarify certain aspects of the language.

- 2011: C++11 Standard (ISO/IEC 14882:2011):

  - C++11, a major revision of the language, introduced numerous new features, including auto keyword, lambda expressions, and smart pointers.
  - This marked a significant milestone in modernizing and enhancing the language.

- 2014: C++14 Standard:

  - C++14 was a minor update that added some features and improvements over C++11 without introducing major changes.

- 2017: C++17 Standard (ISO/IEC 14882:2017):

  - C++17 brought several new features, improvements, and bug fixes to the language, enhancing its expressiveness and standard library.

- 2020s: Ongoing Development:

  - C++ continues to evolve, with ongoing efforts to further enhance the language.
  - The C++20 standard introduced additional features, and future standards are planned to continue the evolution of the language.

## üêß C++ Overview:

    ‚Ä¢ C++ is a general-purpose, high-performance programming language.
    ‚Ä¢ It is an extension of the C programming language with additional features.

### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):

    ‚Ä¢ C++ supports object-oriented programming paradigm.
    ‚Ä¢ Encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism are key OOP concepts in C++.

### Multi-paradigm Language:

    ‚Ä¢ C++ supports procedural, object-oriented, and generic programming paradigms.
    ‚Ä¢ It provides flexibility for different programming styles.

### Cross-Platform Development:

    ‚Ä¢ C++ is known for its portability and is widely used for cross-platform development.
    ‚Ä¢ Code written in C++ can run on various operating systems.

### Popular Applications:

    ‚Ä¢ C++ is used in various domains, including system programming, game development, embedded systems, and more.
    ‚Ä¢ It has been the foundation for many software systems and applications.

## ‚öì Setting Up the Development Environment :

### Setting up C++ on Your Laptop:

1. Install a C++ Compiler:

   - Windows:

     - Install MinGW (Minimalist GNU for Windows) or use Visual Studio with C++ support.
     - For MinGW, download and follow the installation instructions: MinGW Installation Guide
     - For Visual Studio, download and install Visual Studio: Visual Studio

   - Mac:

     - Install Xcode Command Line Tools. Open Terminal and run:
       - xcode-select --install

   - Linux:

     - Most Linux distributions come with GCC (GNU Compiler Collection). You can install it using your package manager:
       - sudo apt-get install g++
     - For other distributions, use the respective package manager.

2. Text Editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE):

   - Choose a text editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text) or an IDE (e.g., Visual Studio, CLion) for writing C++ code.
   - Install the chosen tool according to its documentation.

3. Verify Installation:
   - Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command to verify the C++ compiler installation:
     - For GCC on Linux or MinGW on Windows
       - g++ --version
     - For Visual Studio on Windows
       - cl
